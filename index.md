# Have you ever.....

Worked in a team where you are the only person or maybe, if you are lucky, have 1 other person working with you? Have you ever been instructed or encouraged to spin up a Scrum team for a short project? Has your customer ever asked you to run this project in a Scrum way, despite you being a really small team? Have you ever ran a solo project and tried to apply some of your normal team size practices in an attempt to generate more value?

I know a growing number of people and indeed industry areas get asked this question almost daily. Consultants tend to work as solo practitioners or in very small teams as the customer does not have the budget to afford a full fledged team. Students completing final year projects or undergoing a research thesis are playing a solo game. Open source developers who are contributing to projects in their spare time are doing so largely on their own. 

# Why Scrum?
Scrum has become one of the most popular frameworks for bringing Agility to a team. To the point that many people now interchanged Agile with Scrum, and vice versa. That ubiquity is driving a lot of the requests to follow the Scrum framework.

## What is Small Scale Scrum

The result of several years of research is Small Scale Scrum, a long-awaited and novel concept in agile “supporting planning, developing, and delivering production-quality software solutions.” Small, in this case, is a team size of 1-2, which is below the recommended team size of 3 that the Scrum Guide recommends. According to an extensive survey, this is something the industry, customers, and small development teams have been asking for, as this team size is more realistic for their needs. Organizations that engage in consultancy projects are particularly asking for ways to run scrum projects with one or two developers, due to the industry-wide acknowledgment of the approach’s efficiency. Given that scrum has amended its guidebook to include non-software industries, this approach could benefit many different sectors.
